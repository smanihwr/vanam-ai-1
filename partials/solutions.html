                <h3>Animal Population Monitoring</h3>
                <p>AI-powered camera traps and sensors enable efficient tracking of species populations. We analyze
                    migration patterns and identify potential threats rapidly to inform timely conservation actions.</p>

                <h3>Poaching Prevention & Anti-Trafficking</h3>
                <p>Our intelligent surveillance systems, including drones, radar, and camera traps, combined with
                    real-time analytics, detect illegal poaching activities early, ensuring faster response to protect
                    endangered wildlife.</p>

                <h3>Habitat Mapping & Ecosystem Monitoring</h3>
                <p>Using satellite imagery, drones, and ground-level data, our AI models map habitats and assess
                    ecosystem health. This helps identify environmental threats like deforestation and supports
                    proactive ecosystem management.</p>
